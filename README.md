# Learn Solidity through Examples

If you are already familiar with some programming languages, as well as core concpets of Blockchain, this repository could be a good step to gain some hands-on skills on programming in Solidity and testing using different platforms, like truffle, Web3, and Hardhat.

A good number of projects here, are my solutiolns to some challenges in [Solidity By Example](https://solidity-by-example.org).

This repository is a work-in-progress and I try to keep it updated with the newer version of Solidity compiler and testing frameworks.
